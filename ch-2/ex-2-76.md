## data-directed style

the data-directed styled is additive for a new type we need to
create a new installation package

need to update all the package for adding an operation

## message-passing style

the message passing style is also additive for a new type we need to create a new constuctor with its internal dispatch procecure

need to update all the constructor to add a new operation

## explicit dispatch style

for the explicit dispatch we need to create new procedures for the new types without having any conflicts with the name of the other types procedures and add the new procedures into the generic operation procedures.

needs to create a new procedure to add new operation

If we have new types are often created i think message passing and data-directed are better and if new operation must be added explicit dispact style is better because it require you to only create one procedure instead of modifying the already existing ones
