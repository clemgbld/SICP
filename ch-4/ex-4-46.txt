our parser wouldn't work because we need to read the sentence left to right (like in real life) in order to generate the different combination possible

(parse '(the student with the cat sleeps in the class))

for this sentence we can't parse it by starting from right we need to reverse it if the evaluator evaluate the operands from right to left
