- Ben realized that his accumulation won't work properly because
of the duplicated result that can come out of the query which can cause
wrong result because the accumulation prodedure may accumulate the same result multiple time

- One methode he can use to solve his problem is to first transform the stream of record into a set like data structure
who remove duplicate base on an equality procedure who can tell if two record are equal or not
