a - I support the point of view of Eva like the author of the book said in the foot note
the point of view of Ben Bitdidlle produce an incorrect error thus it is better to
generate an error or achieve a simulatanous definition but achieve that can be not worth it because it is expensive

b - Maybe we can sort the define by order of which define use which , with the exemple of the exercise

(define a 5)
and then
(define b (+ a x))

which will re-define a thus leading to the correct result

if there is define that use each other we leave them as they are and
generate an error in case we run into the edge case presented in the exercise
