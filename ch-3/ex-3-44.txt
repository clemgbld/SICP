If we assume that the balance in from-account is at least amount
then Louis is wrong because the essential difference between the
transfer problem and the exchange problem is that the exchange
problem make a computation based on the accounts balance and the
transfer problem (which is more simple ) don't do that and it is
that computation that can lead to incorrects balance if the exchange
is not serialized with the accounts's serializers.
